# Raftly

A Java implementation of the Raft Consensus Algorithm, designed for distributed systems coordination and consensus.

## Overview

Raftly is a clean, efficient implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Java. The Raft algorithm provides a way to achieve consensus across a cluster of nodes, making it essential for building distributed systems.

### Key Features

- Leader Election
- Log Replication
- Safety Guarantees
- Cluster Management
